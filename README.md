# Important Points

- `assembleWebpack` is used as a plugin to provide the required configurations and to compile handlebar files using assembler.io during Webpack build.
- We also need `assemble-webpack` as a loader to compile Handlebars files with extension `hbs`

**Note**: Until you link the required resources in your project's dependency graph, Webpack will NOT be able to track it for any changes during `Watch` mode or while running `Webpack-dev-server`.

So even though `assembleWebpack` plugin generates the output during Webpack build, you still need to explicitly `import/require` the Handlebar resources somewhere in your project so that it can be re-compiled on the respective file changes.
